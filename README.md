# Introduction:
This project explores how proximity to the equator influences various weather parameters such as humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and temperature. The study was conducted using real-time weather data collected from cities worldwide, analyzing their geographical proximity to the equator to draw conclusions about weather patterns.

# Data Collection:
The OpenWeatherMap API was utilized to gather weather data for cities around the world.
A list of random cities was generated, and their coordinates were used to fetch real-time weather data.
Cities were categorized based on their proximity to the equator (Northern Hemisphere vs. Southern Hemisphere).
Four main weather parameters were analyzed: humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and temperature (in Celsius).
Data was processed and analyzed to identify trends and patterns in each category.

## Conclusion:

Proximity to the equator has a substantial impact on weather patterns. Cities near the equator generally experience higher humidity, moderate cloudiness, lower wind speeds, and consistently warm temperatures.
Away from the equator, weather patterns become more varied, influenced by regional and local factors, leading to diverse conditions in humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and temperature.
